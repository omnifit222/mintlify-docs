This lead should appear in your  OmnifitAI dashboard as well as in the Help Desk you have integrated.

### **Still Not Working, Let’s Troubleshoot\!**

If you are not getting dummy lead from your Bot to Help Desk, it may be due to the multiple reasons:

- Wrong Authorization Details added- You will be required to check and see if all the authorization credentials such as Access Token, Account ID have been entered correctly.
- Free plan- You are not subscribed to the paid plan on  OmnifitAI as integration works only in paid plan.
