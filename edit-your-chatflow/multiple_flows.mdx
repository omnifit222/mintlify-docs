With the option to create multiple flows in your website chatbot, you can easily connect different flows using the redirect component. Here’s how to set it up:

## **How to create a trigger flow:**

1. **Create a New Flow**:
   - Select your website bot and navigate to the "Edit Your Chatflow" section.
   - Click on "Create New Flow" (as shown in the screenshot).
   - Now enter the "Flowname" and click on the "Create new flow".
   - Configure this new chat flow . It will appear in the flow list on this page.
2. **Set Up Redirect in a Previous Flow**:
   - Go to the existing flow where you want to trigger the new flow.
   - Add the "Redirect" chat component (as shown in the screenshot).
   - From the dropdown, select the flow you wish to redirect to.
3. **Flow Redirection**:
   - Once set, the bot will automatically redirect to the selected flow when the redirect component is triggered within the conversation.

This allows you to seamlessly connect multiple flows within one chatbot, enhancing the flexibility of your chat interactions on the website.
