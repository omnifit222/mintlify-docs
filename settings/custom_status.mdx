## **What are Custom Status**

The **Custom Status** section in OmnifitAI allows you to define and manage your own chat statuses for better tracking and workflow alignment within the **Inbox**. These statuses serve as labels to help your team identify the state of a conversation—such as "Pending Response", "Escalated", "Resolved"—and more, all based on your operational needs.

## **Benefits of Custom Status**

- **Workflow Clarity**: Clearly define stages in a customer conversation lifecycle such as “Follow-Up Needed” or “Waiting for User”.
- **Color Coding**: Assign a unique color to each status for immediate visual identification inside the Inbox.
- **Custom Typing**: Select the type of status—e.g., Open, Closed, or Pending—to fit your resolution flow.
- **Inbox Optimization**: Quickly filter and manage chats based on their assigned custom status.
